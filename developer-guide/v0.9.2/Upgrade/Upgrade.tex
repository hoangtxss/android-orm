\chapter {\Large{Database Upgrade}}
Over time the requirement of the database within the application may change, this is almost inevitable if your application is in active development and you're constantly adding new features. Properly upgrading the database in application is important, because if something goes wrong application will have unexpected behaviour (such as crashing) or app may may loose its all data and have to start over.

\textbf{SQLite Limitation}: SQLite supports a limited subset of ALTER TABLE. The ALTER TABLE command in SQLite allows the user to rename a tablet or to add a new column to an existing table. It is not possible to rename a column, remove a column, or add or remove constraints from a table. But you can alter table column datatype or other property by the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item \small BEGIN TRANSACTION
	\item \small CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE t1\_backup(a, b);
	\item \small INSERT INTO t1\_backup SELECT a, b FROM t1;
	\item \small DROP TABLE
	\item \small CREATE TABLE t1(a, b);
	\item \small INSERT INTO t1 SELECT a, b FROM t1\_backup;
	\item \small DROP TABLE t1\_backup;
	\item \small COMMIT

\end{enumerate}
