<!-- 

ApplicationDescriptor.si.xml is the one who connects application to SIMINOV. It contains properties which defines the behaviour of application.

Application Descriptor Elements: 
	
	i. General Properties About Application.
		
		-> name* : Name of application. It is mandatory field. If any resources created by application then it will be under folder named on it.
		
		-> description: Description of application. It is optional field.

		-> version: Version of application. It is mandatory field. Default is 0.0.
		

		
	ii. Framework Performance Properties.
	
		-> load_initially: true/false: ORM(Object Relational Mapping) to be done at start of application or at the time of need. 
							It is optional field. By default its false, means mapping is done when its required. 
							
		
		
	iii. Database Descriptor Paths Used In Application 
			- Path of all database descriptor's used in application.
			- Every database descriptor have its own database object.


	
	iv. Event Handlers Implemented By Application.
		- SIMINOV FRAMEWORK provides two type of event handlers
	
			-> ISiminovEvents: It contains events associated with life cycle of SIMINOV.
				such as (coreInitialized, firstTimeSiminovInitialized, coreStoped).
	
		
			-> IDatabaseEvents: It contains events associated with database operations.
				such as (databaseCreated, databaseDroped, tableCreated, tableDroped, indexCreated).

		- Application can have implementation of this two event listeners.
