 * Exposes API's to return sum of all non-NULL values in the group.
 * If there are no non-NULL input rows then sum() returns NULL but total() returns 0.0.
 * NULL is not normally a helpful result for the sum of no rows but the SQL standard requires it and most other SQL database engines implement sum() that way so SQLite does it in the same way in order to be compatible.
 * The result of sum() is an integer value if all non-NULL inputs are integers.
